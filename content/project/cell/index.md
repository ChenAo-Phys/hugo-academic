In the stochastic cellular automaton, each site represents a biological cell and has three possible states -- proliferative (red), quiescent (grey) and dead/vacant (white). The interaction between sites are controlled by a few parameters. The system exhibits oscillating, wave, compact or fractal patterns under specific parameters, which reflects the mechanism of the collective behavior of cells.
