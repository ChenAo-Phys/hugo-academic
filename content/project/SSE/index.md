The stochastic series expansion (SSE) is used to study the phase diagram of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model. In the animations, the x-axis shows different atoms in the chain and the y-axis shows the slices in SSE. Each frame represents a Monte Carlo step. The color of sites represents the occupation number of bosons -- white (0), grey (1) and black (2).
