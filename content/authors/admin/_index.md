I am a master student studying physics in ETH Zurich. I like to use analytic and computational methods to tackle the problems in physics and in my everyday life.

My research direction is the application of artificial neural networks in quantum many-body systems. My current work focuses on solving the ground state of quantum many-body problem using the neural network quantum state (NQS).
