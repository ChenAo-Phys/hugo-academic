I am a PhD candidate studying physics at University of Augsburg. I like to use analytic and computational methods to tackle problems in physics and in everyday life.

My research direction is the application of artificial neural networks in quantum many-body problems. My current work focuses on solving quantum systems using neural network quantum states (NQS).
