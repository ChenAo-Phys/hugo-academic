I am a master student studying physics in ETH Zurich. I like to use analytic and computational methods to tackle problems in physics and in everyday life.

My research direction is the application of artificial neural networks in quantum many-body problems. My current work focuses on solving the ground state of quantum systems using the neural network quantum state (NQS).

I am looking for a PhD position in computational physics. Please feel free to contact me if you know any possible position suitable for me.
