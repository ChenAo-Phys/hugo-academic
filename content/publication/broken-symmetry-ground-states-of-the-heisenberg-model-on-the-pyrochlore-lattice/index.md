  The spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice is an iconic
  frustrated three-dimensional

  spin system with a rich phase diagram. Besides hosting several ordered phases, the model is debated

  to possess a spin-liquid ground state when only nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions are

  present. Here, we contest this hypothesis with an extensive numerical investigation using both

  exact diagonalization and complementary variational techniques. Specifically, we employ a RVB-like

  many-variable Monte Carlo ansatz and convolutional neural network quantum states for (variational)

  calculations with up to 4×4^3 and 4×3^3 spins, respectively. We demonstrate that these techniques

  yield consistent results, allowing for reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. Our main

  results are (1) the determination of the phase transition between the putative spin-liquid phase and

  the neighboring magnetically ordered phase and (2) a careful characterization of the ground state in

  terms of symmetry-breaking tendencies. We find clear indications of spontaneously broken inversion

  and rotational symmetry, calling the scenario of a featureless quantum spin-liquid into question. Our

  work showcases how many-variable variational techniques can be used to make progress in answering

  challenging questions about three-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.
