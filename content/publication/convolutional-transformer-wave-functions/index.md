abstract: Deep neural quantum states have recently achieved remarkable
  performance in solving challenging quantum many-body problems. While
  transformer networks appear particularly promising due to their success in
  computer science, we show that previously reported transformer wave functions
  haven't so far been capable to utilize their full power. Here, we introduce
  the convolutional transformer wave function (CTWF). We show that our CTWFs
  exhibit superior performance in ground-state search and non-equilibrium
  dynamics compared to previous results, demonstrating promising capacity in
  complex quantum problems.
