abstract: "A single convolutional neural network (CNN) can be applied to systems
  with di\verent sizes. Based on this

  property, we proposed a transfer learning scheme for the neural network
  quantum state in which the CNN

  was \frstly trained by the exact diagonalization result in a small system,
  and then applied to the larger system

  for further variational optimization. This transfer learning scheme improved
  the accuracy and the stability in

  the 1D frustrated J1-J2 model compared with direct variational
  optimization."
