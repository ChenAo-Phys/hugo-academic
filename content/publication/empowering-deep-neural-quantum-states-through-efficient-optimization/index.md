abstract: Computing the ground state of interacting quantum matter is a
  long-standing challenge, especially for complex two-dimensional systems.
  Recent developments have highlighted the potential of neural quantum states to
  solve the quantum many-body problem by encoding the many-body wavefunction
  into artificial neural networks. However, this method has faced the critical
  limitation that existing optimization algorithms are not suitable for training
  modern large-scale deep network architectures. Here, we introduce a
  minimum-step stochastic-reconfiguration optimization algorithm, which allows
  us to train deep neural quantum states with up to 10^6 parameters. We
  demonstrate our method for paradigmatic frustrated spin-1/2 models on square
  and triangular lattices, for which our trained deep networks approach machine
  precision and yield improved variational energies compared to existing
  results. Equipped with our optimization algorithm, we find numerical evidence
  for gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases in the considered models, an open
  question to date. We present a method that captures the emergent complexity in
  quantum many-body problems through the expressive power of large-scale
  artificial neural networks.
