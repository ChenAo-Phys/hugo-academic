  We use a sign network with discrete output values (+-1) to express the sign
  structure of variational wave

  functions. To replace the traditional stochastic reconfiguration (SR) optimization which only applies to networks with continuous outputs, the evolution strategy (ES) optimization is introduced to train the sign network. The sign network trained by ES learns the exact Marshall sign rule in the square-lattice Heisenberg model and

  improves the accuracy of variational states in the pyrochlore-lattice Heisenberg model. The paper is still in preparation and will be uploaded to arXiv soon.
