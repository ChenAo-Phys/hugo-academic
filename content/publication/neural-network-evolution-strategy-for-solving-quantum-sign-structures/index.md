abstract: "We use a sign network with discrete output values (+-1) to express
  the sign structure of variational wave

  functions. To train the sign network, the evolution strategy (ES) method was
  introduced to replace the

  traditional stochastic recon\fguration (SR) method which only applies to
  networks with continuous outputs.

  The sign network trained by ES learned the exact Marshall sign rule in the
  square-lattice Heisenberg model and

  improved the accuracy of variational states in the pyrochlore-lattice
  Heisenberg model. The paper is still in preparation and will be uploaded to
  arXiv soon."
