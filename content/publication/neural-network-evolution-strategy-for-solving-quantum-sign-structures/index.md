abstract: Feed-forward neural networks are a novel class of variational wave
  functions for correlated many-body quantum systems. Here, we propose a
  specific neural network ansatz suitable for systems with real-valued wave
  functions. Its characteristic is to encode the all-important rugged sign
  structure of a quantum wave function in a convolutional neural network with
  discrete output. Its training is achieved through an evolutionary algorithm.
  We test our variational ansatz and training strategy on two spin-1/2
  Heisenberg models, one on the two-dimensional square lattice and one on the
  three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice. In the former, our ansatz converges with
  high accuracy to the analytically known sign structures of ordered phases. In
  the latter, where such sign structures are a priory unknown, we obtain better
  variational energies than with other neural network states. Our results
  demonstrate the utility of discrete neural networks to solve quantum many-body
  problems. This paper is still in preparation and will be uploaded to arXiv
  soon.
