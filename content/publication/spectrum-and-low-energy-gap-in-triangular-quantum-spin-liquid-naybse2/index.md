abstract: We report neutron scattering, pressure-dependent AC calorimetry, and
  AC magnetic susceptibility measurements of triangular lattice NaYbSe2. We
  observe a continuum of scattering, which is reproduced by matrix product
  simulations, and no phase transition is detected in any bulk measurements.
  Comparison to heat capacity simulations suggest the material is within the
  Heisenberg spin liquid phase. AC Susceptibility shows a significant 23~mK
  downturn, indicating a gap in the magnetic spectrum. The combination of a gap
  with no detectable magnetic order, comparison to theoretical models, and
  comparison to other AYbSe compounds all strongly indicate NaYbSe2 is within
  the quantum spin liquid phase. The gap also allows us to rule out a gapless
  Dirac spin liquid, with a gapped Z2 liquid the most natural explanation.
