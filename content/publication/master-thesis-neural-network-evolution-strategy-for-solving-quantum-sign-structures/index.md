  The application of neural networks in solving quantum many-body systems has
  been a hot point

  in the research of theoretical quantum physics recently. Despite its success in dealing with some

  simple quantum systems, the neural network methods encounter difficulties in finding correct

  sign structures in frustrated systems. In this thesis, we use a numerical optimisation method

  named evolution strategy (ES) to train the network, which is a practice not attempted in

  previous studies. We show that ES can optimise a sign network as an independent or auxiliary

  sign structure of the whole wave function. The performance of ES is tested on the J1-J2 model

  on square and pyrochlore lattices. Our method based on ES gives the best neural network

  result in these frustrated systems compared with previous studies.
