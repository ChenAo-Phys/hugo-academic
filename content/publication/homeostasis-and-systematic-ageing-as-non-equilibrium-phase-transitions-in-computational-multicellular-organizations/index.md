abstract: Being a fatal threat to life, the breakdown of homeostasis in tissues
  is believed to involve multiscale factors ranging from the accumulation of
  genetic damages to the deregulation of metabolic processes. Here, we present a
  prototypical multicellular homeostasis model in the form of a two-dimensional
  stochastic cellular automaton with three cellular states, cell division, cell
  death and cell cycle arrest, of which the state-updating rules are based on
  fundamental cell biology. Despite the simplicity, this model illustrates how
  multicellular organizations can develop into diverse homeostatic patterns with
  distinct morphologies, turnover rates and lifespans without considering
  genetic, metabolic or other exogenous variations. Through mean-field analysis
  and Monteâ€“Carlo simulations, those homeostatic states are found to be
  classified into extinctive, proliferative and degenerative phases, whereas
  healthy multicellular organizations evolve from proliferative to degenerative
  phases over a long time, undergoing a systematic ageing akin to a transition
  into an absorbing state in non-equilibrium physical systems. It is suggested
  that the collapse of homeostasis at the multicellular level may originate from
  the fundamental nature of cell biology regarding the physics of some
  non-equilibrium processes instead of subcellular details.
